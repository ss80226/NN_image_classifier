# Readme
1. This repo implement a two & three layer Neural Network with only python and without any machine learning package.
2. The main perpose of this repo focus on the implementation of the function in NN, like back-propagation using chain rule and the gradient descent to update the weights.
3. In `report.html` file in ` folder`, **as both report and coding comment**, will explain the meaning and logic of my python code step by step
4. The Discussion of performance and decision regions plot are presented at the the report file 
5. If you directly run my python code `nn.py` with command `python nn.py`, it will output the **Cross Entropy loss** and **accuracy** for **Training dataset** for both **2-layer & 3-layer NN** with **6000** iterations (less iterations than that in report for saving ur running time). The **Testing accuracy** will be also showed
6. the hidden dimensions of the neural network are set as 32 in this python file
7. **pls make sure the directories of input data is in the same folder of this python file :)**
